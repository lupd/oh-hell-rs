# Contributing to oh-hell-rs

This project welcomes contributions from everyone, including in the form of
suggestions, bug reports, pull requests, and feedback. 

When reporting a bug or requesting help, include enough details so that
people can reproduce the behavior you are seeing. When reasonable, provide
a [Minimal, Complete and Verifiable Example].

When making a feature request, explain what benefits the new feature(s) would
provide, suggestions on how to design the feature, and any possible
alternatives/disadvantages of the feature.

Try to limit pull requests to a single cohesive feature or bugfix, when
possible. Before submitting the PR, run `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`, and
`cargo fmt`and fix any discovered issues.
